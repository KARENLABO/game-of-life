# THE CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.


# RULES:
-If the cell is alive, it will stay alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbors alive.
-If the cell is dead, then it comes to life only in case it has 3 neighbors alive.
